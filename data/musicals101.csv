History: One of New York's first world-class venues for theatre and
        opera, a fire here in 1866 left a ballet troupe stranded  they wound
        up in the historic Niblo's Garden production of The Black Crook. The Academy was
        rebuilt and remained popular for decades, but as the neighborhood changed in the early 20th century,
        upper class audiences drifted uptown. The auditorium was used as a vaudeville 
        and film house until its demolition in 1926."

        History: Former ship steward William Brown, a free born Caribbean man of
        color, presented the first African American stage entertainments seen in
        New York. He built the American Theatre (which white journalists
        referred to as the African) after success with an 1821 pleasure garden
        in Greenwich Village. Brown's success soon drew hostile response from
        white theatre owners, journalists, and racist mobs. He was forced to close down in
        1823."

History: One of Broadway's most desirable theatres for almost two decades,
        the Astor became a motion picture house from 1925 onwards, serving as MGM's
        premiere New York venue. It underwent an ugly modernization in 1959 and
        continued showing films until 1972. After brief stints as retail and
        storage space, the building sat deserted for several years until it was leveled
        to make way for the Marriott Marquis Hotel.

Later named: Theatre Francaise, Clinton Hall
Demolished: 1860s?
History: Catering to New York's upper classes, this was the site
        of the infamous Astor Place Riot in 1849. A mob of jingoistic Irish immigrants
        violently protested against the appearance of a British actor, and were fired on
        by police  at least eighteen died and hundreds were injured. The Astor
        tried to carry on, but memories of the riot made most managers unwilling
        to book events there. Becoming the Clinton Hall library in 1854, it was
        used as a lecture hall in the 1860s.
Noteworthy Musicals:  A minstrel troupe appeared here in 1853."

Original name: Scudder's American Museum
Built: 1800 (approx.)
Demolished: 1865 (fire)
History: This building serves as New York City's poorhouse for a
        decade before it became Dr. Scudder's 
        American Museum in 1810. P.T. Barnum bought the Museum in 1841, converting it into a 
        popular tourist attraction noted for presenting bizarre exhibits and respectable plays. In 1850, 
        he enlarged the lecture hall into a handsome 3,000 seat auditorium. Respectable people who
        were leery of theatres felt comfortable attending
        performances at a ""museum,"" and Barnum presented an ongoing
        series of plays, minstrel shows and clean variety bills. Despite what
        you see in the fanciful film Gangs of New York, this theatre was
        not destroyed during the draft riots of 1863. After fifteen
        years as one of the most celebrated playhouses in New York, Barnum's
        Museum burned to the ground accidentally in 1865. The location became 
        the new home for the offices of the NY Herald, 
        and Barnum opened his New Museum (see below) at 539 Broadway.

        daily ""educational"" performances. When this structure burned
        three years later, Barnum suspended his theatrical endeavors."

History: Built by tragedian Edwin Booth, this was one of the most
        ornate theatres in New York. Successful productions
        of Hamlet, Richelieu and other classics could not make up
        for Booth's lack of business acumen, and he lost the theatre to
        bankruptcy in 1874. After various managers, it was sold off as retail
        space in 1883. A bust of Shakespeare that once adorned the facade of the
        theatre can still be seen on the office building that currently stands
        at this location.

Demolished:  1929 (fire)
History:  Built on the site of the Bull's Head Tavern, The Bowery
        was the first NY theatre lit by gas. It burned down several times (1828,
        1836, 1838, 1845, 1923) but was so popular that it was rebuilt time and again, becoming the first American theatre
        location to remain in almost constant use for more than 100 years. Undergoing numerous
        changes of management, The Bowery offered a wide variety of entertainments 
        aimed at working class audiences. For many years, its impressive columned facade was
        partially obscured by elevated subway tracks. Renamed 
        the Thalia, this house spent spent its final years as a home for Yiddish
        theatre, where it housed performances by Jacob Adler and Boris
        Thomaschevsky -- competing Yiddish productions played across the street
        at the Windsor. 
        By the time The Bowery suffered its sixth fire
        on June 5, 1929, the neighborhood had fallen on hard times, and the
        owners sold off the property for business use. A Chinese market
        currently stands on this location."

History: Built by the owners of the Hippodrome, the Colonial

        Ziegfeld took over the house and renamed it the Casino 
        for a 1932 revival of  Show Boat  but went bankrupt himself
        months later. After a brief stint as a nightclub, the building
        was converted to retail space in 1940. It was Whelan's Drugs Store,
        which became a Woolworth's, and the public
        gradually forgot that this structure had been a theatre. During 
        demolition in 1990, some of the colorful but long-hidden art deco 
        ornamentation was visible to bemused pedestrians.

        innovative ventilation
        system that blew air over blocks of ice, making this the world's first
        air conditioned theatre. In the 1880s, it was one of the most popular
        venues for operetta. Destroyed by fire in 1891, it was rebuilt at
        the same location and renamed the  Madison
        Square. It became a vaudeville house in 1900
        and hosted burlesque as of 1929. It was a movie house
        when it shut down in the late 1930s.

        The house changed names often over the years. It was

        name housed the historic first performance of The Cradle Will Rock
        in 1937. The house was named for
        actress Molly Picon for a few months in 1942. The Shuberts called it the
        New Century as of 1944, and booked a series of musical hits. NBC
        leased it as a TV studio from 1953 to 1958. After several years of disuse,

History: Built at a cost of $30,000 on Chatham Street (now

        attracted all levels of society, but developed a reputation for catering to its
        wealthier clientele. Over the proscenium was painted the Latin
        motto ""Gnothi Seaution"" -- ""Know Thyself.""  The
        interior was redecorated in 1807 and 1809, with ""patent"" oil
        lamps replacing candlelight. The poor (and prostitutes) sat in the top
        gallery; benches in the pit (what we now call the orchestra section) were 
        reserved for working class men, and wealthy patrons sat in four
        tiers of private boxes named for famous European playwrights. The
        largest box, called ""Shakespeare,"" was usually reserved for
        critics and celebrities. The Park was out of fashion and facing hard times when a
        conveniently timed fire demolished it in 1848. This is currently the location of the
        main J&R Music World store."

Built: 1927
Demolished: 1966
Seats: 1,660
Architect: Joseph Urban
Owners/Managers: Florenz Ziegfeld (1927-1932), Billy Rose (1943-1965)
History: This theatre was an art deco masterpiece with a
        unique egg-shaped auditorium. Placed several blocks Northeast of the
        theatre district, it was a landmark unto itself. After Ziegfeld's death,
        it became a movie venue for a decade until producer Billy
        Rose purchased the theatre and made it his headquarters. The Ziegfeld
        housed a series of long-running hits over the next decade, but its
        uptown location eventually made it less popular. Rose bought adjoining
        properties to make the location attractive to developers, but died
        before he could close a deal. His estate sold off the property for 
        demolition in 1966. A skyscraper and an 1,100 seat movie theatre now 
        share the site. Called The Ziegfeld, the movie house has a
        lobby exhibit covering Ziegfeld's career.
