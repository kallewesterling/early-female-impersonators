***** reflections


*) drag queen appears exclusively in relation to film and television in Entertainment Industry Magazine Archive, until 1975, when it appears for the first time in relation to Jim Bailey who is suing Time Magazine for libel because they depicted him "as a drag queen" in the article. See "Auditorium-Arena: Bailey Sues Time Mag For Libel, Asks $15-Mil," Variety [277, no. 11], January 22, 1975, 80.
*) then: the separation of drag into gay culture (and out of the pages of this archive) seems complete... the rest of them just refer to film and tv with a few Broadway roles etc...
