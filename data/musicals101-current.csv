History: This theatre was named for the mythical Greek god of the sun, 
        who was once worshiped as a patron of the performing arts. Lost by the Selwyn 
        Brothers during the Great Depression, the Apollo became a burlesque house in 1934 
        and a movie house from 1938 to 1978. It returned to theatrical use as the 
        New Apollo in 1979, housing such dramas as On Golden Pond, Bent 
        and Fifth of July. Pointlessly renamed The Academy, it housed a series of 
        rock concerts, and was stripped of its seats to be used as a cabaret (Alcazar de 
        Paris) in 1989. The space fell into disuse in the early 1990s, and the interior 
        was demolished in 1996. Some interior ornamental plaster elements were preserved 
        and used in the new Ford Center, including the Apollo's proscenium arch
        and auditorium dome. Now part of the Hilton.

History: The Lyric was intended as a home for American composer Reginald 
        DeKoven's school of opera  hence, the musically inspired name ""Lyric."" 
        But the school went bankrupt before construction was completed, so it was
        leased to the Shuberts. A movie grind 
        house from 1934 to 1978, the Lyric sat abandoned through its demolition in 1996.
        The Ford Center used the Lyric's original (and sumptuous) 42nd 
        and 43rd Street facades, as well as the lobby dome and other interior ornaments.

History:  This theatre was originally called Theatre
        Masque because it was intended for ""artistic"" dramas.
        Renamed after producer  John Golden in 1937, this intimate house has
        primarily been
        home to dramas and comedies. However, a number of small scale musicals
        have enjoyed successful runs here.
Noteworthy Musicals: Comedy in Music (1953), Beyond
        the Fringe (1952), A Party With Betty Comden and Adolph Green

History:  Originally named after Shakespeare's   Globe  Theatre in
        London, this was the only Broadway theatre with a roof that could open on warm
        evenings  the disabled mechanism is still in place. Producer Charles
        Dillingham lost the theatre during the Great Depression, and it was used
        as a movie house from 1932 through 1957. In 1958, it was renovated and
        named after dramatic stars Alfred Lunt and Lynn
        Fontanne, who made their
        final Broadway appearance here that same year in The Visit. Since
        then, this blue and gold rococo auditorium has been used primarily as a
        venue for musicals.

History: Named for the high rise hotel surrounding it, this

        seemingly who had no clue how to design a working theatre. However,
        excellent sight lines and unusually comfortable seating have made it a

History:  Originally a tennis court, this space was converted by
        the Shuberts and theatrical agent Walter Jordan  who soon sold his
        rights to the Shuberts. When the Shuberts were forced to sell off
        theatres as part of an antitrust settlement, producer Billy Rose bought
        this venue and named it after himself. The Nederlanders bought it and renamed it The National in 1978, then
        named it for
        themselves in 1980. After years of disuse, it became home to the
        long-running Rent in 1996.

Architects:  Herts & Tallant - restored by Hugh Hardy (1994)
History:  The flagship of Klaw and Erlanger's theatrical empire,
        the New Amsterdam (New York City's original Dutch colonial name)
        remains one of America's most outstanding examples of art nouveau 
        architecture. When the Great Depression made tenants scarce in the 1930s, the New
        Amsterdam became a studio for Ed Wynn's radio series. 
        The main theatre served as a movie grind house from 1937 to 1983, at which time the theatre closed
        for ""renovations."" Delays and ownership battles stretched over a decade, until Disney
        took over the property in 1996 and invested $34 million in a sumptuous restoration. 
        After more than a century, The New Amsterdam is once again Broadway's grandest theatre, 
        and is designated an official New York City landmark. A 693 seat rooftop theatre housed 
        Ziegfeld's Frolics, and served as a radio studio and rehearsal space through 
        the 1950s -- unfortunately, it was too far gone to be restored to use.

Architect:  Albert E. Westover (1902); Bigelow, Wallis &
        Cotten (1904)
History: Built by Hammerstein as the 
        Republic, this intimate house was 
        soon leased by producer David  Belasco,
        who renovated the interior and renamed the theatre for himself. When
        Belasco built the Stuyvesant and
        gave it his name in 1910, producer A.H. Woods took over this house and
        promptly renamed it the  Republic again. Home to 
        Minsky's Burlesque from 1930 to 1942, 
        it became a movie grind house during World War II and was patriotically
        named the Victory. Handsomely renovated 
        in 1995, this is now the only theatre in the Broadway area dedicated exclusively to family 
        entertainment. Because the seating capacity was reduced to 489, productions at
        the New Victory are not eligible for Tony Awards. (Not to be
        confused with Hammerstein's Victoria
Theatre, the vaudeville house which used to stand next door at the
        corner of Broadway and 42nd Street.)"

        were several attempts to revive a variety format headed by top stars,
        most notably Judy Garland (1951 and 1967). It became a Broadway house in
        1966. Encased in a high rise hotel since 1990, the theatre's original

        CBS Radio Theatre from 1937 to 1940. At that time, Golden gave
        his name to a neighboring theatre, and the Shuberts renamed this house
        the Royale. It has since been home to dozens of
        hits. In 2004, plans were announced to rename this theatre for the
        late head of the Shubert Organization, Bernard
        Jacobs.

        relatively plain interior was handsomely redesigned in the 1950s, but
        recent renovations have removed a mural that once surrounded the

Architect: Eugene DeRosa
History: Constructed for the Gallo Opera Company, this house soon
        converted to theatrical use. Renamed the New
        Yorker, it housed a series of flops before being converted
        into a posh nightclub called Casino de Paris.
        The space was used as a British style music hall in 1936 and called the
        Palladium. The space served as a CBS studio from 1942 until 1976. In
        1977, promoters Steve Rubell and Ian Schrager turned the space into the
        disco Studio 54, which reigned briefly as New York's glitziest
        nightspot. It is currently one of several venues operated by the
        Roundabout Theatre.

Built: 1911
Seats: originally 1,533 - now 1,495
Owners/Managers: The Shubert Organization
Architect:  William Albert Swasey
History:  This is the only current Broadway theatre space that
        was not built to serve as a performance space. In 1881, William K.
        Vanderbuilt and several partners built this structure to serve as the
        American Horse Exchange, which served for more than two decades as
        Manhattan's premiere center for horse trading, stabling and practice
        riding. In 1911, producer Lew Fields
        had the idea of turning it into a theatre, but the Shuberts quickly took
        over the project, and made the Winter Garden a top night spot. They
        installed exposed steel beams in the auditorium ceiling to look like the
        rooftop ""summer garden"" popular on Broadway at that time. Al Jolson starred
        here in a series of hit musicals from 1911 through
        1925, including La Belle Paree (1911), Sinbad (1918) and Big
        Boy (1925). The postcard photo above left shows how the theatre
        looked when it housed The Passing Show of 1920. The Shuberts had the
        auditorium lavishly redecorated in 1922, improving the acoustics with
        the addition of a new solid ceiling. Jolson filmed scenes of The Jazz Singer here in
        1927. The Winter Garden served as a movie house from 1928 to 1933, and again from 1945 to
        1948. Since then, it has been a fulltime Broadway venue, housing many memorable
        musicals, including West Side Story, Funny Girl, Mame and the
        record-breaking hit Cats.
Noteworthy Musicals: The Passing Show (1912-1924), At
        Home Abroad (1935), Hellzapoppin (1938), The Ziegfeld Follies
        of 1943, Mexican Hayride (1944), As the Girls Go (1948), Top
