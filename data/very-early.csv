Floyd,Kunkel's Nightingale Minstrels,"(The celebrated female impersonator of Kunkel’s Nightingale Opera Troupe. Eventually co-manager with George Kunkel of Marshall Theatre, Richmond, VA. Born 1828 = 26 years old here..

George Kunkel was famous ""Ethiopian minstrel"" - from 1845 the head of the Nightingale Troupe (after George W. Harvey) - immense reputation in a few years - enabling Kunkel with Mr Ford to ""embark extensively in theatrical enterprises"" - Washington (D.C.) Theatre was his second acquisition - Moxley was manager here, ""known as Master Floyd or 'Miss Fanny'."" - ""Mr. Geo. Kunkel's Engagement Abroad, A Representative Minstrel's Eventful Career,"" The Sun (1837-1992); Baltimore, Md. [Baltimore, Md]18 July 1882: 4.

Kunkel's Opera Troupe was ""one of many enterprises that stamped their names on Spanish coins. One such coin, a 2-real piece of 1823, is in this collection."" - The Sun (1837-1992); Baltimore, Md. [Baltimore, Md]15 May 1949: MG5.","The Sun (1837-1992); Baltimore, Md. [Baltimore, Md]25 Nov 1854: 2.

Ford, of Ford's Theatre in Washington."" - Rick G. Mundy, ""Theatrical Pariah: John Wilkes Booth and literature of the theatre"" (diss.), 22, n. 12

""The presence of Thomas L. Moxley in the partnership is difficult to explain. He did little actual management, functioning on a few isolated occasions as ""acting manager"" only. A possible explanation of his association with Kunkel and Ford is that he may have won the gratitude of the two for contributing to the success of the Nightingales as a popular featured performer, and it may be that he had earned enough as a minstrel to become a silent partner. In 1871, eleven years after the partnership had dissolved, Ford employed him to handle the wardrobe of Ford's new Grand Opera House, and in 1873 he was bartender of the Holliday Street Theatre bar. Both of these lowly appointments were probably partly effected through the influence of his brother, Basil Moxley, for many years Ford's faithful doorman."" - John Ford Sollers, ""The Theatrical Career of John T.

Female impersonators have always been a source of deep-seated disgust to me, but Stuart compelled attention and is more impressive from a purely artistic point of view than any of these gentlemen who don skirts and furbellows for the amusement of the public. If ever a man has mastered those little details of femininity, he certainly has. In all things, he remained well within the character, and without exaggerating it got about all that there was to be extracted from the role, which has been discussed so roundly since the burlesque was first produced. Stuart has certainly forged his way to the front in recent years, and will, if he keeps on, be commanding widespread attention soon. It was not many seasons back that he was one of the permanent attractions in the concert halls over the Rhine, and very few paid much attention to him then. Now, however, he is found at the head of his own company, and if he is not entitled to rank as the best female impersonator on the American stage, he is crowding the possessor of that title closely for his laurels.","Cincinnati Enquirer (1872-1922); Cincinnati, Ohio [Cincinnati, Ohio]09 Apr 1899: 29.
